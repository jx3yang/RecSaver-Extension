# RecSaver-Extension

## Description

RecSaver is a chrome extension to save your last seen YouTube recommendations. YouTube recommendations can appear in three places, two of which are closely related: the home page, the sidebar when viewing a video, and the recommendations after a video ends. For each of the three categories, the extension will save the last 200 unique video recommendations.
